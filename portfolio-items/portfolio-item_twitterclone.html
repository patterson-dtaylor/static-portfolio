          What better way to test out your skills as a developer than to try and tackle one of the most iconic social
          media apps. As the app name states, TwitterClone is a replica of Twitter. I wanted to replicate Twitter to 
          practice MVVM structural design, dive further with OOP, programmatically build every UIView, practice building
           a cloud database through Firebase, as well as direct messaging functionality through Firebase as well.

              What can't be said already about Firebase that hasn't been stated yet? It's fast, easy to learn, and can be
              implemented with Apple's sign in functionality.  I used Firebase's Cloud Firestore and Authentication capabilities
              to register new users, send and receive tweets and direct messages, as well as the link functionality.  I chose
              Firebase because of its ease of use and how fast the cloud database is.

            <h3 class="tools-list__title"><strong>MVVM</strong>A better approach to iOS Design Pattern.</h3>
            <p>
              When I first started out learning iOS development, I learned all I could about MVC (the design pattern used by Apple).
              However, after research, discussions with another (paid) iOS developer, and just the shear realization how massive
              code can become in MVC or Massive View Conroller, I started to look for a better design approach to my coding architecture
              then came MVVM.  I've wanted to use MVVM for a while now, but most of my projects have been small and MVC being fine for 
              what I was doing. I chose to use MVVM for TwitterClone due to the size of the app and moving parts, and this way I could 
              neatly keep each functionality separate thus resulting in cleaner and more readable code.  This wasn't an easy task, and 
              it took me a bit to get use to the design pattern, but I really like the way MVVM has made me think more about how my code
              looks as well as the functionality of it.  Plus, it really makes you practice your OOP and POP programming fundamentals.

              <strong>Sketch</strong> A digital design toolkit.
            </h3>
            <p>
              What I love about iOS development is you have fill the roll of a full stack developer. In one moment you're networking with APIs
              and creating backend functionality through CoreData or Firebase all the while keeping in mind to make the app look pretty with 
              UI/UX elements for the user. For the "pretty" aspect, I wanted to learn a tool that was built for UI/UX design, used in the 
              industry, and did not have a steep learning curve.  Sketch has fit every need thus far.  Every mockup picture on my portfolio was
              built with swift as well as many of the buttons, backgrounds, and screens used in my applications. Sketch is an invaluable tool 
              that has made me look at iOS design with a much different eye.

        <h3 class="portfolio-item__section-heading">Challenges and Further Improvements</h3>
        <p>
          This was a super fun project to learn how to build and design.  I wanted a big project with a lot of moving parts, and I think I got 
          it with TwitterClone.  The major challenges that I faced was keeping with the MVVC design pattern and constantly thinking about how 
          the architecture of my code needed to be designed so that it was cohesive. I knew what it should look like, come on it's Twitter, but 
          building something like this was out of my wheel house. Although, with proper research, reading documentation, and trial and error, 
          TwitterClone has been one of the best projects yet. Some further improvements I would like to make would be the functionality of a side-
          bar that displays the user's menu options.
